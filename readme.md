# An App Just For Her 💖💖💞💓💝💝

<h3> My hands are shaking right now while I am writing about her. 
<br>
I don't know what I gonna write further but the only thing I know is that today I just want to write.

<br>
I have no guts to propose her, and I have no idea what to do. 😔
The only way I can explain my feelings with is "Coding".
Now this is my only option. I am gonna write a whole app just for her.
☹️
<br>
Believing that one day she will see my code repository, and download this app from release page.
Only that day she will know How must I liked her. 🥰
<br> I am Now going to write an App For Her.
<br>
You heared right. The only way I found to propose her is this. 
<br>
This is random, I have no idea if she will ever open my github profile and read my code and install this app.
But hope keeps me alive ! 😖
<br>
I hope she will really do it one day. That day will come surely. Then I don't care about the result, If she answer yes or no. The only thing I am concerned about is that my message should be sent to her. As I have no guts, there is no other way, if she actually care about me. she will open it one day. 
😢
<br>
Now about her: 
<br>
I don't have words, 😶
<br>
This is no more just a physical attraction, this is something of far beyond, I know I don't look good and also that I don't deserve her. But that doen't mean that will stop seeing her and there is no way thinking that she might not like me at all. How can I decide it. I have no right to predetermine anything, I just want to be with her, and I wanna go through this process. Whenever I look at her, I know she is for me. whenever she smiles in front of me, maybe for anything, I smile too for no reason.
😄
<br>
😖
I always show that i am not at all interested in her. But from inside I <strong>Love </strong>her. <br> Yes !. I spelled the correct word. <br> I love her(maybe), I am still not sure. How can i even decide. without talking to her, I have no reason to think of it but still I have some feeling that maybe I love her.
<br>
'Cause I care for her. I want to see her face every morning. I don't care where. 
<br>
I become sad when she doesn't come to college.
<br>
I become hopeless when she ignores me.
<br>
I become depressed when she doesn't reply me.
<br>
Yes!
<br>
What more i can say. 
<br>
See, 
<br>
I am not a kind of guy that have a lot of words to explaing this phenomenon, All I know is that I have hope.
<br>
I do not have money, I do not have enough clothes to look good enough for her.. I always spray perfume to smell good for her. I want to see her, I ofter reminds her of her attandence whenever she forget. Sometimes I forget mine too for reminding her. But she doesn't remind me. I don't know if she even know my roll no. 
<br>
But sill I have hope that maybe there is some hope.

<br>
I want to earn for her.
<br>
I want her to be with me.
<br>
I want to fulfill all her needs.
<br>
Yes!
<br>
'Cause I have hope.
<br>
That may be this is what I have to do and this is the cost that i have to pay just to be with her. 
<br>
I can write a whole book about her but right now I will try to stop here.
<br>
My hands are not ready to stop yet. and mind dosn't let me stop, It says why are you stopping. .. You have a lot of memories about her .. TELL THEM!! .. I am sure that  I will put them in this app.
<br>
I will also put a song their that I usually listen while thinking of her.
<br>
I HOPE SHE READS THIS AND SHE DOWNLOADS IT.
<br>
I usually call myself a Vedik Developer.
But Today I will call myself "Her Developer"
A programmer only for her.
